# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the members of the Luminar Core community, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Be Respectful**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect. Engage in constructive dialogue and be open to feedback.
- **Be Inclusive**: Actively seek to include people from diverse backgrounds. Encourage and respect different perspectives.
- **Be Professional**: Conduct yourself in a professional manner. Avoid personal attacks and focus on the issues at hand.
- **Be Considerate**: Be mindful of how your words and actions might affect others. Respect differing opinions and experiences.
- **Be Supportive**: Offer support and encouragement to others. Share knowledge and resources to help others succeed.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment**: Any form of harassment, including but not limited to offensive comments, threats, or unwanted advances.
- **Discrimination**: Any form of discrimination or exclusion based on personal characteristics, such as race, gender, or sexual orientation.
- **Personal Attacks**: Attacks or insults directed at individuals rather than addressing issues constructively.
- **Disruptive Behavior**: Behavior that disrupts the productive and positive environment of the community, including spam or off-topic comments.
- **Trolling**: Engaging in behavior intended to provoke or disrupt the community, including spreading false information or inflammatory remarks.

## Reporting

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We will take appropriate action to address any violations, which may include warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the community.

## Enforcement

Consequences for violating the Code of Conduct may include:

- **Warnings**: Issuing a warning to the individual regarding their behavior.
